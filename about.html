        This web site is intended for keyboard users who would like to have more comfort (or speed) while typing on a
        QWERTY layout.
    </p>
    <p>
        The typing prompt will alternate between patterns that encourage both hands to hover in the
        center of the keyboard, common words in the English language, or common words in computer programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        The text prompts traverse most characters on a standard QWERTY layout. It can be difficult traversing this many
        characters. Compared to typing only words: 25 words per minute is “good”, 35+ is “great”, and 50+ is
        “phenomenal”.
